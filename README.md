# üöÄ RampNet ‚Äì Omnichain On-Ramping Infrastructure

**RampNet** is a seamless, programmable on/off-ramping protocol designed for the omnichain era. It enables users to move funds between fiat (via Wise) and supported blockchain networks with minimal friction, leveraging the most advanced cross-chain infrastructure available today.

> üöß **Note:** In the current version, **only on-ramping is enabled**. Off-ramping is planned for a future release.

## üîó What RampNet Enables (v1)

- ‚úÖ **On-Ramp**: Users send fiat (USD) via Wise and receive native tokens on their chosen blockchain (e.g., XRP on XRPL, USDT0 on Flare...)
- ‚ùå **Off-Ramp**: _Coming soon_ ‚Äì Users will be able to send tokens from supported chains and receive fiat directly to their bank account.
- üß© **Programmable**: Built around smart contracts, Oracles & cross-chain messaging (Flare FDC, FTSO, LayerZero).

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Fiat integration** via Wise (global banking rails)
- **Attestation & Proofs** powered by Flare Data Connector (FDC)
- **Price feeds** via Flare Time Series Oracle (FTSO)
- **Cross-chain execution** using fAssets, Flare EVM, and LayerZero OApp
- **Smart contract-based distribution** of native assets on target chains
- **Privy integration** for seamless Web3 onboarding with social logins across all supported chains
- **Hardhat v3** is used as the primary framework for testing and network simulation

## üåê Supported Chains

RampNet currently supports the following chains for token delivery and liquidity management:

- Mantle
- Katana
- Flow
- Hedera
- Zircuit
- XRPL (XRP Ledger)
- (soon) All EVM-compatible chains supported by LayerZero OApp and chains supporting fAssets.
